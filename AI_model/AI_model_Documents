>>> Kernel 訓練:
		1. rbf : 非線性
		2. poly : 非線性

				poly 當中的degree 將會使用當rbf kernel訓練或進行PCA分析時所得出的
				最佳特徵數量，透過挑選最佳特徵數量的方式，來決定選用poly kernel時，
				當中的degree值。

>>>PCA Result show that : 
		When PC1 ， percentage got almost 80%, 
		when I concat PC1 and PC2 also show the majority phenomenon. 

		=> When i looking at the SVR + PCA training score,
			 it also show that when i use choose the PCA n_comonents as 1,
			 the result still occupy the 1th place.
			 

>>>ICA Result show that : 
		When I set the ICA components 1 ,shows the lowest mse result
		=> But here comes an issue that it seems overfitting 
			 because training score or lower than testing score
		So I going to set the ICA components as 1 ,it show the 2th place score. 
		=> And there isn't any issue that looks like overfitting
		... So i gonna choose ICA n components as 1 for ICA + SVR training
